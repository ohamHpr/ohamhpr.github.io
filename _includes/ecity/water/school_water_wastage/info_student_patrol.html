                    The initial solution was to assign each student the task of 
                    monitoring taps and closing them at every break time. 
                    (Considering an average of 150 students per school and a maximum of 5 breaks each day). 
                    This approach aimed to mitigate water wastage, but we encountered issues such as damp patrols and 
                    students deliberately neglecting to close taps, possibly due to shifting responsibility to the patrols.
