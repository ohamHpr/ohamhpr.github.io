    Waiting for Hot Water</h3>

            When waiting for hot water, it's common to let water run down the drain until it reaches the desired temperature. 
            This process can result in significant water and energy wastage over time. 
            The primary reasons for this wastage are the distance between the water heater and the tap, as well as poorly insulated plumbing systems.

    There were several practical investigations documented in my notebooks to substantiate this as a 
    genuine area for improvement. In my efforts to confirm that other users elsewhere were also facing the same issue, 
    I found it helpful to engage in discussions with other water heater installation experts and plumbers. 
    It became apparent that attempting to decrease the distance between the water heater and the point of use in response 
    to user requests was a common practice.

    However, we were all operating under a faulty assumption! After a bit of lateral thinking, 
    I noticed that regulations had begun to mandate the installation of gas water heaters far 
    from interior areas, possibly due to concerns about oxygen depletion.

        I came up with an initial idea of adding a third pipe to collect cold water and return it to
        a storage, thereby eliminating water wastage and ensuring safe hot water preparation. 
        Refining the initial idea by allowing deeper issues to surface during the development phase is a key aspect 
        of iterative problem-solving.
