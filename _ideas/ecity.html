        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <p>
                While cities confront a multitude of challenges, my focus centers on three foundational elements crucial 
                for the sustainability and growth of civilization:
                <ol>
                        <li><strong>Energy Efficiency:</strong> Prioritizing the reduction of energy consumption.</li>
                        <li><strong>Water Management:</strong> Implementing  integrated water management systems.</li>
                        <li><strong>Infrastructure Development:</strong> Enhancing connectivity, accessibility, and quality of life for residents.</li>
                </ol>
                <ul class="d-none">
                        <li>1. <strong>Energy Control:</strong>
                                Implementing remote monitoring and control mechanisms to manage energy consumption effectively, 
                                optimizing usage and reducing wastage.
                        </li>
                        <li>2. <strong>Reducing Water Wastage:</strong>
                                Addressing the issue of rampant water wastage through the development of efficient 
                                water management systems.
                        </li>
                        <li>3. <strong>Streamlining Transportation:</strong>
                                Tackling traffic congestion and transportation inefficiencies through the design of 
                                smart mobility solutions and infrastructure improvements.
                        </li>
                        <li>4. <strong>Promoting Tech-Integrated Lifestyles:</strong>
                                Fostering acceptance and integration of technology into modern life, encouraging individuals to 
                                embrace technological interventions for sustainable living practices.
                        </li>

        <h2>Approach</h2>
        <p>
                Despite narrowing down the possibilities for a perfect design to just the aforementioned challenges,
                the project still loomed monumentally before me. I naturally gravitated towards a method akin to a heuristic approach to make
                progress rather than endlessly contemplating.

        <h2>Discovery</h2>
        <p>
                As a trusted technical services provider with dozens of clients,
                the documented findings and firsthand empirical observations provided a rich repository of insights, 
                serving as the basis for a field study.
                Drawing from this wealth of data, several key insights shaped the direction of the project.
