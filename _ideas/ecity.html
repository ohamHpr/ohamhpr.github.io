        <p>
        Living in a mid-sized city with limited access to electronic chipsets and other resources didn't hinder 
        my passion to achieve my goal. I started with the knowledge I had and steadily made progress 
        toward the future. I immersed myself in all the electronics books I could find and brainstormed the 
        necessary services I had listed. Through designing complex circuits, I developed the higher-level modules 
        needed to bring my vision to life.

        <h3>Internal Network</h3>
        <p>
                the internal network was designed to facilitate efficient communication between devices through 
                a shared bus system. Each device communicated by sending and receiving messages over this bus, 
                listening for relevant data, detecting it, and executing the necessary actions. 
                The bus operation was managed by shift registers, essential for controlling the data flow. 
                Data transmission involved converting parallel data to serial format using a parallel-to-serial 
                converter and then sending it over the bus. At the receiving end, a serial-to-parallel converter 
                transformed the serial data back into parallel format for processing. 
                This method ensured seamless and orderly communication between devices, 
                leveraging a straightforward yet powerful approach to network design.
